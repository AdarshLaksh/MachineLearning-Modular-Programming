## End to End Machine Learning Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline for predicting student performance indicators based on various features. It includes modules for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, selecting the best model and also,deployment.
The concepts covered in this project are :
    1. Understanding the Problem Statement
    2. Data Collection
    3. Data Checks to perform
    4. Exploratory data analysis
    5. Data Pre-Processing
    6. Model Training
    7. Choosing the best model

Note : A detailed demonstration of the above concepts has been provided in the "data/EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE.ipynb
